Sing to the tune of "A Casa", by Vinicius de Moraes

This is the story of Bolsonaro
Ex-military, an awful fellow

He was elected parlamentarian
But his true aim was authoritarian

Supporting torture, guns and munition,
A firing squad for the opposition

Bashing First Nations, gays, human rights
Bribing the Congress took on new heights

Another coup with the military
Must be stopped by all means necessary
